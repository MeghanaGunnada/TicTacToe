# TicTacToe
This is a 3*3 grid game.
players should give their names for 'x' player and 'o' player.
The player who has all o's or all x's in same row or same column or same diagonal will be declared as a winner.
I used tiiny.host website and uploaded my tictactoe folder containing codes in html,css and js files.
